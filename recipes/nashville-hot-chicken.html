        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Arrange chicken pieces in a large bowl  
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk buttermilk, pickle brine, hot sauce, and egg together 
                in a mixing bowl. Pour marinade over chicken and stir to ensure 
                each piece is thoroughly coated. Cover and let chicken marinate 
                in refrigerator 2 to 4 hours
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix flour and salt together in a shallow flat dish. Remove chicken 
                from marinade and blot with paper towels. Reserve marinade. Toss chicken 
                in flour until thoroughly coated. Return chicken to marinade, coating all 
                sides; remove chicken from marinade allowing excess to drip back into the 
                bowl. Coat the chicken once again in flour mixture. Place on a rack. 
                Repeat with all chicken pieces. Allow to sit out about 15 minutes to allow 
                coating to dry out a bit
            </li>
            <li>
                Place butter and lard in a large pot. Add cayenne pepper, brown sugar, 
                paprika, garlic powder, kosher salt, and black pepper. Place over 
                medium-high heat. Cook and stir until fats melt. Remove from heat; keep 
                sauce warm
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill cast iron skillet about 1/3 of the way with vegetable oil. Heat oil 
                to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Carefully place chicken into hot 
                oil, skin side down. Maintain an oil temperature of 325 degrees F, 
                adjusting heat as need. Fry until instant read thermometer reads 160 
                degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes per side
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer chicken to a rack to drain. Brush with the sauce on both sides
