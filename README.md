# recipes
In this project, I practiced my HTML skills by creating recipes for three
different meals and adding a name, image, description, unordered list of 
ingredients, and ordered directions for each recipe. I also 
practiced links by having index.html link to each recipe and having
a back button on each recipe's page to link back to index.html.

This project has been updated with CSS to show my understanding of
CSS properties like the box model.
